(This is a [now](https://nownownow.com/about) page, where I write things that I’d tell a friend I hadn’t seen in a year.)

## personal brand

I am developing a personal brand to share with others how do I get my feeling of importance, what are my beliefs and values, and my expertise. Part of that effort will be to keep improving this website over the coming weeks and months.

## storytelling

Do any of you have trouble remembering good memories? My mom is a storyteller, and everyone that meets her is fascinated with her stories. I, however, have a hard time sharing my stories and can't seem to remember stories that I am present in. As I meet with my 20s, I would like to explore how stories are shared within cultures and families to better understand my childhood and my relationship with the present.

## figma

As for specific learning goals, I'm trying to improve my frontend web development skills and my UI/UX design skills. I am currently familiarizing myself with [Figma](https://www.figma.com/) and the <mark>UX Maturity model<mark>.

## three.js

Animation(that is cartoons and anime) brought me comfort and stability in times of uncertainty.<br> Learning [Three.js](https://threejs.org/) and Blender is how I would like to honor that. I am currently enrolled in [Three.js Journey](https://threejs-journey.com/)[^1] and curious how these all would interact in the area of Web Accessibility.

[^1]: I'm appreciating Bruno's teaching method.
