Hi, I'm **Andre**:

I am a third year Computer Science major, and Statistics and Analytics minor. I graduate in 2023, and I am [most likely] looking for an internship or in-field experience. I'm experienced in Python, Java, SQL, and R, &amp familiar with JS, HTML/CSS and C/C++. I take pleasure in refining my skills and translating creative ideas into logical instructions. My desire to serve others and their environment has strengthened with each person and experience I’ve had the opportunity to encounter, and it’s what drew me to the activities I’ve participated in over the years. The impact of each experience, together with early exposure to varying economic and social perspectives, has fostered my fascination for science and technology.

Specific areas of interest include: Data Engineering and <mark>Visualization</mark>, Machine Learning, and Artificial Intelligence.

In my spare time, I love <mark>creating art</mark>, <mark>writing stories</mark>, wandering the outdoors(<mark>travelling</mark>), and watching anime/animated series.
I also enjoy reading(check out what I am reading **now**)
 
Grew up in *Venezuela* and *Dominican Republic*; moved to *US(Texas, Tennessee)* and *Jamaica* during my teens; returned to *Texas* in 2020.

Coming from the Caribbean, marine science is dear to my heart.
